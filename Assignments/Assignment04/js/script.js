Using jQuery UI's draggable and droppable methods to
feed a hungry mouth!

  eww.play();
}

// flyDropped(event,ui)
//
// Called when a draggable element is dragged over the droppable element (the mouth)
// In this instance it can only be the fly (it's the only draggable element).
// The arguments 'event' and 'ui' are automatically passed by jQuery UI and contain
// helpful information about the event.
function flyDropped (event,ui) {
  // When we drop the fly into the mouth we should remove the fly from the page
  // ui contains a reference to the draggable element that was just dropped in ui.draggable
  // .remove() removes the select element from the page
  ui.draggable.remove(); // $fly.remove() would work here too
  // We should "close the mouth" by changing its image
  // .attr() lets us change specific attributes on HTML element by specifying the attribute
  // and then what we want to set it to - in this case the 'src' attribute to the closed image
  $(this).attr('src','assets/images/mouth-closed.png');
  // Now the fly is gone we should stop its buzzing
  buzzSFX.pause();
  // And start the crunching sound effect of chewing
  crunchSFX.play();
  // Use a setInterval to call the chew() function over and over
  setInterval(chew,250);
}

// chew()
//
// Swaps the mouth image between closed and open and plays the crunching SFX

  // We can use .attr() to check the value of an attribute to
  // In this case we check if the image is the open mouth
  if ($mouth.attr('src') === 'assets/images/mouth-open.png') {
    // If it is, we set the 'src' attribute to the closed mouth
    $mouth.attr('src','assets/images/mouth-closed.png');
    // and play the crunching
    crunchSFX.play();
  }
  else {
    // Otherwise the 'src' attribute must have been the closed mouth
    // so we swap it for the open mouth
